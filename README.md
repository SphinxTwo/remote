# Overview

This is the official remote client for [Hadouken](https://github.com/hadouken/hadouken). It is
a pure HTML/JavaScript application which you can host yourself or access
at [remote.hdkn.net](http://remote.hdkn.net). The application uses CORS to request data from
Hadouken which means all requests go directly from your browser to your Hadouken
instance.

## Getting started

To get started with development, just clone the repository and then run `npm install`
followed by `gulp serve`.

You should now be able to access the web application at `localhost:3000`.
